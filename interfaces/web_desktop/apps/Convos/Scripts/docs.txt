How connection to video conference works
----------------------------------------

Normal scenario, initiating a call:

Host: Clicks video button
Host: Creates conference id
Host: Stores conference settings in FShared
Host: Open video and send from video window: "broadcast-call"
Host: Runs xconference.broadcastStart()
Host: Sends 'broadcast-start' to Invitee

Invi: Receives 'broadcast-start'
Invi: Runs xconference.broadcastAccept()
Invi: Confirms accepting
Invi: Runs xconference.answerVideoCall()
Invi: Creates conference structure with conference id
Invi: Opens view
Invi: Sends 'broadcast-received' to Host
Invi: Runs xconference.addConnection() to add user to conference by id
Invi: Sends 'broadcast-connect' to Invitee

Host: Receives 'broadcast-connect'
Host: Runs xconference.connectToInvitee()
Host: Sends 'initcall' to view


How external invitees connect from outside of Friend OS
-------------------------------------------------------

 * Invitee gets a http link and follows it
 * Friend OS Catch All system picks up the event
 * Checks the conference link, is it still active?
 * Is the conference determined at a specific time?
   + Show count down
   + or Show expired
   + or give access with a button, write your name
 * If not just give access with a button, write your name
 * You enter the conference, with only the video conference part of 
    convos being extracted to run (invited.html)
