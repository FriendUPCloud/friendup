How connection to video conference works
----------------------------------------

Normal scenario, initiating a call:

Host: Clicks video button
Host: Creates conference id
Host: Open video and send from video window: "broadcast-call"
Host: Runs xconference.broadcastStart()
Host: Sends 'broadcast-start' to Invitee

Invi: Receives 'broadcast-start'
Invi: Runs xconference.broadcastAccept()
Invi: Confirms accepting
Invi: Runs xconference.answerVideoCall()
Invi: Creates conference structure with conference id
Invi: Opens view
Invi: Sends 'broadcast-received' to Host

Host: Runs xconference.addConnection() to add user to conference by id
Host: Sends 'broadcast-connect' to Invitee

Invi: Receives 'broadcast-connect'
Invi: Runs xconference.connectToHost()
Invi: Sends 'initcall' to view
