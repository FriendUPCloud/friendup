First login script options (modules/system/include/firstlogin.php).
This script is executed only once when the user logs in for the very first time.
-----------------------------------------

To change the behavior of first login script start the Server App in Friend
and create an item with type "global" and key "firstlogin".

Then add any of the keys:
    welcome_app
    update_info
    show_system_icon
    create_home_dir
    show_eula

The value should be either 0 or 1 (single zero or one).

If a key is missing it will default to 1 (defaults are set at the beginning of firstlogin.php).

-----------------------------------------

App preinstallation

Start the Server App and add a key named "preinstall_apps" to global/firstlogin.
It should contain the list of app names separated by commas (NO EXTRA SPACES, no quotes).

Example: Mitra,Author,Calculator

The names follow directory names in interfaces/web_desktop/apps/

-----------------------------------------

Dock mode

Some customers want to have a Windows-like taskbar instead of the dock.
To do that start the Server App and add a key named "dock_windowlist" to global/firstlogin.
The value should be "dockedlist" (without the quotes).

-----------------------------------------

Dock placement
As above - add property "dock_settings" with the value of:

{"options":{"position":"aligned","layout":"bottom_center","size":59,"dockx":"0","docky":"0","workspace":"1"}}

Don't worry if it will contain lost of escaped quotes - it is stored just fine in the DB.
