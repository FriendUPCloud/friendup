How to set up server

1. node/npm must be installed. Using 'n' is advised: https://github.com/tj/n
   Version must be 4.4.5 or higher.

2.a 'example.config.js' must be COPIED to 'config.js'
  b Edit 'config.js' to have the correct TLS paths ( uncomment, can use FC key/cert )
  and domains / ports / proxies

3. make install to move files to build/services/FriendNetwork ( this will change )

4. Go to destination dir and do 'npm install', you should now also have a dir called 'node_modules'

5. run server with 'node fnet.js'
