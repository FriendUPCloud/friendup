In  FriendCore, a  system sentinel  is available  to do  gatekeeper and  ganitor 
tasks. He will distribute access to shared data as a central node.

To activate the sentinel, add a user of any level to your users database and
generate a session for him. After this, add the username and password in plain
text to your config file like this:

--

[Core]

SentinelUsername = "myusername";
SentinelPassword = "mypassword";

--

This will make sure that the sentinel is authenticated and activated when Friend 
Core is initialized.

To administrate the resources  available to the sentinel,  just log in with  his
username  and password to access his desktop. He is, essentially, a normal user.
This allows you to connect  remote fs drives  to him,  and other resources, that
may be shared between users on the same Friend Core.

To generate a session for the sentinel user, just log in as him. Do not log out.
Just close the tab or reload it without logging out using the menu item. You can
also generate a session id using the Sessions tab in the Users app.

Sentinel is defined in systembase.h,  friendcore.c and user_sessionmanager.c for
those developer who dares inspect him.

Permissions

The system sentinel is not a  normal user,  even though  it  has a  normal  user 
account in the database. The system sentinel has some restrictions. For example,
it  can  share  resources  between  users  on  the  network.  But  only with the 
restrictions  applied. If  a system sentinel shares a drive using remote fs, the
user can mount the drive without any username or password. But the user will not
get  write  or delete  permissions. This  is  because  these  privileges are not 
permitted for  the  sentinel user, even if the sentinel user is of role "admin".
