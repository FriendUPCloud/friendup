Introduction
------------

FUI - or Friend GUI, is the basis for the HTML based GUI engine in FriendUP.
It uses CSS and some base classes to achieve an uniform look across themes.

HTML
----

Applications need various GUI elements to be useful, and FriendUP is no 
different. In FriendUP, we're utilizing the web browser toolkit to render our
GUI. We've chosen to use CSS and HTML to build graphical interfaces. To do this, 
we've designed CSS classes that provides you with an expressive GUI.

To create a basic FUI - or Friend(UP) User Interface, you start by making a
design template for use in your app. If your app is called "demo_app", your
template will be inn:

	demo_app/Templates/mytemplate.html
  
To open it, use a File object, pointing to Progdir:, a shortcut to where your
app is installed:

// When application runs
Application.run = function( msg, interface )
{
	// Make a view
	var w = new View( { title: 'MyWindow', width: 640, height: 640 } );
	
	// Apply the template on the view
	var f = new File( 'Progdir:Templates/mytemplate.html' );
	f.onLoad = function( data )
	{
		w.setContent( data );
	}
	f.load();
}

Let's take a look at the template. TODO..

Icons
-----

FriendUP bases itself on the Font Awesome class set. This makes it easy to use
icons, depending on theme. The icons are ment for toolbars and buttons, and is
used this way:

<button class="IconSmall fa-check-circle">
	This is my accept button
</button>

This will give a nice checkbox icon before the text.

When using an input field next to the button, the height of the input field
should be matched. This is done this way:

<input type="text" value="somevalue..." class="IconHeightSmall"/>

The icon height should match the button icon height. The heights are:

IconSmall  - IconHeightSmall
IconMedium - IconHeightMedium
IconLarge  - IconHeightLarge

Containers, boxes and layout
----------------------------

FUI (Friend User Interface) is a very simple GUI setup that uses CSS and HTML5.
Using some simple classes, you can make almost any user interface you want.

When working with GUI in Friend, you use HTML5 templates with associated CSS.
Often times, you add the CSS inline - but the most elegant way is to separate
the layout CSS code in a separate file.
