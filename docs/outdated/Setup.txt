How to compile
--------------

To setup FriendUP on a local server, you need to build the Friend Core 
executable from source, build the web client, and install. This is thusly done.

In the FriendUP source folder:

	make clean - clean all objects and binaries
	make setup - create required directories and files
	make compile - compile source in debug mode
	make install - install all generated components to build directory
	make release - compile source without debug. Be sure that 'make clean'
		was called before.

This will generate a build/ folder in the root directory. You then need to run
Friend Core to access the web client.

	cd build/
	./FriendCore
	
This runs Friend Core with the default settings - as defined in the file:
	
	build/cfg/cfg.ini

This file must be setup for Friend Core to successfully run. Check the file

	docs/cfg.ini.example

for an example setup. An example configuration contain:

group [DatabaseUser]
 login - name of database user
 password - database user password
 host - address of database server
 dbname - name of database
 port - port on which database is working

group [FriendCore]
 fchost - name of host on which FriendCore will start
 port - port number on which FriendCore will start
 fcupload - path to file upload folder

group [Cores]
 servers - servers splitted by comma and divided for 2 sections
  localhost - address of server
  @ - split char
  local - name of the server provided to FriendCore
This configuration is temporary, later all connections will be handled automaticaly.

group [Core]
 port - friend core port
 epollevents - epoll event size
 networkbuffer - network buffer size
 epolleventscom - epoll event size for communication service
 networkbuffercom - network buffer size for communication service
 wsport - websockets port
 SSLEnable - 1/0 enable/disable SSL
 WSSSLEnable - 1/0 enable/disable WebSockets SSL
 DeveloperMode - 1/0 enable/disable developer mode (disable file cache'ing, more debug, etc.).

group [Log]
 level - indicate which minimal level of log messages should appear in conosole. Below list of
 levels and their numbers which should be placed in config file:
	FLOG_LIVE   1
	FLOG_INFO   2
	FLOG_WARN   3
	FLOG_DEBUG  4
	FLOG_ERROR  5
	FLOG_FATAL  6
	FLOG_PANIC  7
 fileLevel - same information but only for entries which will appear in file log
 fileName - name of log file (+date will be added automatically)

Dependencies, database
----------------------

Friend Core requires some components / applications to run. You need to install
mysql-server and mysql-client v5 or later. Then you need to setup the Friend 
Core database, using the structure found in the file: 

	docs/FriendCoreDatabase.sql

Here, you need to setup a user account, using an unencrypted password. This will
later be encrypted by the system, don't worry!

Other dependencies
------------------

C dependencies (using "apt-get install" as superuser)

	libssh2-1-dev
	libssh-dev
	libssl-dev
	libaio-dev
	libxml2-dev
	php5-cli
	php5-curl
	php5-mysql
	php5-gd
	php5-imap
	mysql-server
	libmysqlclient-dev
	build-essential
	libmatheval-dev (for testing math service)
	libmagic-dev
	libgd-dev
	libwebsockets-dev
	rsync
	valgrind-dbg
	cmake

	Ex.:
	sudo apt-get install libssh2-1-dev libssh-dev libssl-dev libaio-dev \
	php5-cli php5-curl php5-mysql php5-gd php5-imap mysql-server \
	libmysqlclient-dev build-essential libmatheval-dev libmagic-dev \
	libgd-dev libwebsockets-dev rsync valgrind-dbg libxml2-dev php5-readline \
	cmake
	
IMPORTANT!
If during project compilation/setup/cleanup you will see information:
"Cannot locate header file MagickWand.h during imagick configuring"
make link to proper include files folder
ln -s /usr/local/include/ImageMagick-6 /usr/local/include/ImageMagick

Server host configuration
-------------------------

Friend applications run under serveral domains. This is for security, to make
full use of the sandboxing technologies in modern web browsers. By default, 
FriendUP uses two domains - ex.:

	localhost:6502
	utilities.localhost:6502

So, if your domain is: mydomain.com, then the utility domain would be:

	utilities.mydomain.com

This has to be setup on the host/dns setup where you are serving from.

Setting up PHP modules
----------------------

Some modules will not be enabled by apt-get automatically. This is the
way to enable them manually:

phpenmod imap
