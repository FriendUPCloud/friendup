Security in Friend Core / Friend Workspace
------------------------------------------

Subdomains for effective sandboxing
-----------------------------------

Friend Workspace uses iframes for sandboxing applications. This allows developers
to  use all the HTML5 features they love while at the same time making  sure that
the applications only have access to the resources they need.

To set this up, add a comma separated list in the config file (cfg.ini) like so:

domains = mydomain1.com, sub.mydomain1.com, other.mydomain1.com

This will make these domains available to Friend Core and Friend Workspace to use
for secured applications.
