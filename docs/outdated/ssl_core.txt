FC SSL connection
-----------------

For developers:
---------------

To disable SSL server, please remove flag -DENABLE_SSL from core/Makefile

For users:
----------

To generate your certs, use this (with your crt and key):

openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out certificate.pem -days 360 -nodes

Copy this certificate.pem to:

build/cfg/crt/certificate.pem

Add to cfg.ini (mind the casing!)

[Core]

SSLEnable = 1;

When SSLEnable will be set to 1 then websockets will be secured too.
