How to configure Friend OS
==========================

Once you have built and/or installed Friend OS on your server, you need to
configure it properly. Each Friend OS server can be used for many different 
purposes - from running a community to simply serving an app.

Here is a list of configuration options, and what they mean.

Sections
========

The Friend OS configuration file is located in your build/cfg/cfg.ini file. 
If you do not have such a file, you have got a broken installation. The config
file is sectioned, so here is a description of configuration options along 
with what they mean. If you wonder about config file formatting rules, please
take a look here for the *ini* format.

 * [INI file format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file)
 
We have commented the sections with semicolon ; - do not add these to your own
configuration file.

Entries which start with ! are required.
