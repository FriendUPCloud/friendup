	<strong>The Friend Workspace is a great cloud storage facility! Have you tried
	dragging a file from your local PC and dropping it on the Workspace?</strong>
</p>
<p>
	To put your files into Friend is easy - just move your browser window to the side,
	and select files and folders from your local PC or Mac, and drag them into the 
	Friend Workspace. Your files will be uploaded to your <strong>Home:Downloads/</strong> folder.

<p>
	You can also upload files to a specific folder. For example, you can open <strong>Home:Documents/</strong>
	in the Friend Workspace - and then drag your local files and folders into that file window, and the upload
	will place your files there.
