<h1>
	Have you tried sharing a file?
</h1>
<p>
	<strong>On your workspace, you have a Shared drive. This drive displays all the 
	files that you have shared with others, and the files that others have
	shared with you.</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<img src="/system.library/module/?module=tutorials&command=getimage&number=6&sessionid={session}"/>
</p>
<p>
	When opening the Shared drive, you can drag and drop a file to its window,
	and you will get a share dialog. Here you can search up other users and 
	groups and share directly.
