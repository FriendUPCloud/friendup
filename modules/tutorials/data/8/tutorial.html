<h2>
	How do you add storage space?
</h2>
<p>
	Sometimes, you may need more storage space - or attach existing storage, 
	like Dropbox or Google drive?
</p>
<p>
	By right-clicking on the Friend Workspace (where the wallpaper is), you can
	choose Add Storage. This will attach a new disk on your workspace. Bear in
	mind that different users may have access to different types of storage.
