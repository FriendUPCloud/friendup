<h2>
	Do you like desktop shortcuts?
</h2>
<p>
	You can drag files, folders and even start menu shortcuts onto your Workspace,
	where your wallpaper is. This way, you can easily access these items on 
	the right side of your screen with a simple doubleclick on your desktop.
</p>
<p>
	The shortcut icons are easily removed with your right click menu and "Delete shortcut".
	The actual files will not be affected.
