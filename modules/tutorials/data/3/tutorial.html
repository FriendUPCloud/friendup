<h2>
	Have you tried the right click menu?
</h2>
<p>
	When using the right mouse button over various objects, you get a helpful
	menu that allows you to do something with it. We call that the context menu.
</p>
<p>
	Try using your right click menu over icons, the dock or the Workspace
	wallpaper. The menu items tell what you can do.
