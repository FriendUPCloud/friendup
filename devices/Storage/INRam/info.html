	INRAM stands for Instance Network Random Access Memory. The INRam driver
	allows a client to access its distributed Networked server RAM Instance.
	The drive is great for sharing small bits of information with other users
	across a network. Built for speed, this is the drive to use for multiuser
	purposes.
