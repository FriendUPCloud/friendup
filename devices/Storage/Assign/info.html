	The assign DOS driver allows you to combine various file system
	paths into one virtual file system. This is useful for making
	dynamic drives that put several directories together as one.
	It can also be used to alias paths to make them simpler to access.

<p>
	The assign DOS driver is triggered by the DOS command "assign".
	Read more about this command in the Friend DOS documentation.
