	The Personal Filesystem DOS driver allows you to abstract an SQL database
	as a filesystem with disk based binary storage. The SQL drive
	gives you the ability to program the behaviour of your file 
	system to fit your needs, and is therefore a great template
	for intelligent, dynamic file systems.
