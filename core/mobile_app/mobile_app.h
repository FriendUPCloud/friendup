/* This module provides internal notification API that is used to send
 * notifications to mobile app users (for example: FriendChat messages
 * or live call requests when the app is paused/suspended).
 *
 * ******************************************************************
 * Messages originating from the app:
 *
 * Login (start of session):
 * App: { "t" : "login", "user" : "someuser", "pass" : "hash_of_somepassword" }
 * Response: { "t" : "login", "status" : 1, "keepalive" : number }
 * Keepalive indicates how often the server will ping. If nothing is received within that time
 * the app should assume that the connection is broken.
 *
 * App is put to pause (suspend/background/etc.):
 * App: { "t" : "pause" }
 * Server: { "t" : "pause", "status" : 1 }
 *
 * App is resumed:
 * App: { "t" : "resume" }
 * Server: { "t" : "resume", "status" : 1 }
 *
 * ******************************************************************
 * Messages originating from the server:
 *
 * Ping request:
 * Server:  {"t":"keepalive","status":1}
 * App:     {"t":"echo"}
